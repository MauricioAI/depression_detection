Depression is one of the most underestimated illnesses that affect people the most, with an estimated 280 million people suffering from this mental disorder. The world today lives fully connected, where more than half of the world's population uses social networks in their daily lives. If we interpret and understand the feelings associated with a social media post, we can help a large portion of potential depression cases to be diagnosed before they reach a state that brings major consequences for the patient. This paper proposes the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment associated with a post made on a tweet. This sentiment can be non-depressive, neutral, or depressive. The data was collected and validated by the authors and pre-processed and feature-generation techniques such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec were used. Hybrid CNN+LSTM, Transformer based, and Ensemble models were tested. The train results show that the best model to classify the possible depression sentiment inherent in a tweet is the Extra trees classifier combined with the TF-IDF technique. It achieved 82.9% accuracy.
